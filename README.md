# env-mult-clk-domain

## Project Description

This repository is meant for learning some concepts of UVM using SystemVerilog. Through a verification environment, some hardware verification concepts are applied for a Arithmetic Logic Unit to perform calculations with values stored in registers through a register bank.

## 🔨 Project Features

This project is capable of performing functional verification of a ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) developed in Systemverilog by creating a verification environment developed according to the UVM methodology.

## ✔️ Techniques and technologies used

- `Systemverilog`
- `UVM`
- `Functional Verification`
- `Xcelium Logic Simulator`
- `Verification environment handling more than one clock`
- `Virtual Sequences`

## 📁 Access to the project

You can [download the project's source code](https://github.com/MarleyLobao/UVM-mult-clk-domain.git).

## 🛠️ Execute the project

The Makefile in the `tb/rundir/` directory has the following options:
- `make sim`: Run the project with Xcelium Logic Simulator from Cadence;
- `make gui`: Run the simulation using Simvision's GUI.

When you run `parallel_test` you should notice at the end of the log 10000 matches with the reference model 🏆
